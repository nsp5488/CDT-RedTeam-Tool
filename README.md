# CDT-RedTeam-Tool
This code is able to generate a dropper for a windows machine that will load its payload into memory and then exit. The current shellcode is set to be a keylogger, but it can be made into any other payload using MSFVenom and then recompiling the dropper.cpp file

NOTE: the code must be compiled on a Windows machine
